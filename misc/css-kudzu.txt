* Object-oriented CSS - the way forward?
* 1.9mb Facebook CSS, went on a diet, reduced response time by 1/2 within 6 months
* Dont match CSS granularity to PHP objects
* A good start is headings - creating a library for the site, then picking those elements to generate a page
* Dust-me selectors? Track over time
* An element needs to be predictable, i.e. dont use...
    #foo h3 {}
    #bar h3 {}
  There are only 6 headings and only so many font-sizes you will use
* Specificity is killing the cascade
  - use hacks sparingly, dont use .ie, use _zoom etc
  - avoid styling ids - too specific + better for Javascript
  - avoid !important except on leaf nodes - very end and wont effect cascade
  - definitely style classes without elements e.g.
    .error { ... most of the code here ... }
    div.error { }
    p.error { exceptions only }
    em.error { exceptions only }
* Duplication - CSS on steriods - Grep?
  - too many floats = you need grids!
