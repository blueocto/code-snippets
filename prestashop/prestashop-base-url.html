<!--
	If you are developing a website and will be moving from one URL/Domain to another, it easier to have href="thedomain.com/whateverthepage.php"

	So to do this in a Prestashop theme use the following code.


{$base_dir}
     
Example:

-->
     
<a href="{$base_dir}content/6-about-us">About Us</span></a>
